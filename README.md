# QR-code detection

A simple project to locate QR-code. No decoding.

## Compile

Contains a Visual Studio solution configuration (VS2015). Debug | x86 and Release | x86 tested. You need to change the include and libraries direction of your OpenCV.

You can also compile it on other OS. There is no OS-based code.

## OpenCV

I compiled it with OpenCV 2.4.11. You may try other version yourself.
